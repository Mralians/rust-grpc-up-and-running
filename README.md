# Rust gRPC: Up and Running

This repo contains Rust implementations of the exercises and examples from the book "gRPC: Up and Running: Building Cloud Native Applications with Go and Java for Docker and Kubernetes" by Kasun Indrasiri and Danesh Kuruppu.

Since the book's code samples use Go and Java, this repo aims to provide equivalent Rust code.
